This file is a Amino-acid grouping file for use with NEWBOX.
Each line contains a set of amino acids which are considered
'similar' when calculating the consensus. The .SIM file is different
and is used in colouring residues that are "similar" to a single
consensus residue.
This table was taken from ClustalW v1.60
Other format requirements are the same as for SIMPLIFY.TXT in the
GCG-package.
