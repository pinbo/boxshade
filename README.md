# boxshade
This is a modified version of the original C version boxshade.

The original boxshade website is not accessible anymore, so I found the C source at [OpenSUSE's repository](https://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/opensuse/repositories/science/openSUSE_Leap_15.3/src/boxshade-3.3.1-lp153.1.9.src.rpm).

I made several modifications to make it work better, including:

- Fix the adding ruler bug (infinite loop)
- support for fasta file input
