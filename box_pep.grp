This file is a Amino-acid grouping file for use with NEWBOX.
Each line contains a set of amino acids which are considered 
'similar' when calculating the consensus. The .SIM file is different 
and is used in colouring residues that are "similar" to a single 
consensus residue.
Other format requirements are the same as for SIMPLIFY.TXT in the 
GCG-package.
